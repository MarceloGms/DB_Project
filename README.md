# Musicfy
This project aims at developing a simplified music streaming platform.
The system is available through a REST API that allows the user to access it through HTTP requests (when content is needed, JSON must be used).
The user interacts with the web server and the web server interacts with the database server through an SQL interface (psycopg2).
